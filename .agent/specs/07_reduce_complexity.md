Okay, we can consider the design locked and the application feature complete at this point. Now let's take a look at the code we've written in order to accomplish it. How can we reduce the complexity? What can we improve? And overall, how can we make it so that this is a really nice, clean implementation of the problem with no fluff or anything?

Anything unnecessary? A few things I can think of based on skimming are really complex stuff. These should have explanatory comments or examples. We should make sure wherever relevant we're using the base UI components and not redoing CSS ourselves with Tailwind. You should know what is available through shadcn, and make sure you're not duplicating anything. In addition, just go through all the code like an absolute artist and expert and come up with a laundry list of improvements that could be made. Then we can go through together and filter and come up with a plan for tightening this codebase.
