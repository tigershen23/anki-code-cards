- Do manual tests, compile issues
- Read implementation

We've implemented the first pass at the functionality, and these are all of my notes on things I found while I was testing that need to be fixed. At this level, things are mostly functionality related. So it's the baseline of does this thing work, and we need to please fix all of these. Please do so using tasks. 

- Get rid of "preview modes", there should only be what is currently called "edit" mode, and make sure to get rid of all the associated dead code
- Shift-tab should de-dent, the same way Tab de-dents. It doesn't right now.
- Closing brace }]) as the first chracter on a line doesn't auto-dedent the line, it should.
- Cmd-Z should undo anything in the editor, including adding a cloze.
- This doesn't work:   10. Cmd+Shift+/ - Should insert comment cloze above current line with correct comment syntax (// for JS, /* */ for CSS)
- The toasts are too fat, icon is tacky, make them look better
- CLOZE_START_3 and CLOZE_START_2 tokens are actually showing in the preview and copied output HTML, with the current exampl. c1:: seems to be working though. Not all the time. Figure out how and why this could be happening, I could help debug if you need or are stumped.
- The whole top left buttons UI is useless, get rid of it, we can re-add later but for now all of those controls will be keyboard driven. For balance, maybe put a title there for now.

When you are done please give me another set of manual tests to run, slimmed down from before, to test anything that has changed.

TODO:

- Figure out how to run tailwind, separate process can't be the answer
- Figure out how to separate e2e smoke test from the rest of the tests
